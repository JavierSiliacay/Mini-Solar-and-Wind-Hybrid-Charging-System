Project Workflow

System Power-Up
The Arduino Nano is powered by energy supplied from the solar panel and wind turbine charging system through a regulated power source.

Pin Initialization

Two infrared sensors are configured as digital inputs.

Four LEDs (red and green for each sensor) are configured as digital outputs.

Serial communication is initialized for status monitoring.

Continuous Sensor Reading
The Arduino continuously reads the digital states of both infrared sensors inside the main loop.

Dual Sensor Detection Check

If both sensors detect motion simultaneously (LOW state), the system enters a high-alert mode.

Both red LEDs blink rapidly to indicate a critical detection condition.

Normal sensor processing is temporarily skipped during this alert state.

Individual Sensor Evaluation
If only one sensor detects motion:

The corresponding red LED turns ON.

The corresponding green LED turns OFF.

The other sensor continues normal operation independently.

Normal Monitoring State

If no motion is detected, both green LEDs remain ON.

Red LEDs remain OFF, indicating normal system status.

Visual Feedback Output
LED indicators provide immediate visual feedback for:

Normal operation

Single-sensor detection

Dual-sensor high-alert condition

Serial Monitoring
When both sensors detect motion, an alert message is printed to the Serial Monitor for debugging and observation.

Loop Repetition
The system repeats the monitoring and decision process continuously with a short delay to ensure stable and responsive operation.
